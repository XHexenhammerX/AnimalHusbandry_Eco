# AnimalHusbandry Eco

An updated version of the popular Animal Husbandry mod for the game Eco.

## Latest fixes (Feb 15)

- Fixed recipe for Electric Butchery Table to require Steel Plates, Saw Blades, and Industry labor, as intended by the original author. The recipe was previously changed to require boards, hewn logs, and Carpentry labor, which didn't make sense for a modern machine requiring electricity.
- Rebuilt the mod's unity package in the included Client folder, fixing issues with the meshes of the smallPen and animalFeeder that resulted in inside-out meshes, as well as removing an unused sample mesh (Polyhymnia statue).
- Created 3 world objects and 14 item prefabs from scratch and assigned icons to them, with the new meshes in separate FBX files for easier future development.
- Added instructions for future developers to work on the client side part of the mod, by bringing the Client folder into a unity installation with ModKit installed, then into a unity project and building asset bundle via the AnimalHusbandryClient scene under the "ModKit" menu.

## Installation
