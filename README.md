# AnimalHusbandry Eco

An updated version of the popular Animal Husbandry mod for the game Eco.

## Latest fixes

- Fixed lvl 6 talent selection (Icons for talents are still missing but talents have tooltips and do work)
- Added 250W Electric Power requirement to the currently Not-So-Electric Butchery Table
- Fixed lack of collision between Electric Butchery Table and other objects
- Adjusted Advanced Scrap Meat recipe to 15cal (down from 120cal)

## Why upgrade?

The Electric Butchery Table offers better yield and takes fewer calories compared to its early game counterpart, making it a more efficient option for players.
